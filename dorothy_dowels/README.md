## Dowel Pin Configurations

### Description

The first part of Dorothy's Dowels was to make the dowel pin configurations. I made configurations for length, diameter, and having a chamfer. Below is a
 table of those different dowel pin configurations:

This is the default configuration for the dowel pin.

### Reflection

The Dowel Pin was very easy to make, and Onshape configurations were surprisingly simple to use. It took me a minute or two to grasp exactly what I needed
to do to make a configuration, but once I got past that, they were statisfyingly simple and effective.

## Frame Configurations

### Description

The second part of the Dorothy's Dowels assignment was the frame. The frame was a 2" wide trapeziod with 45Â° sides, and had two configurations for it's 
length: the long version was 12" long, and the short version was 8" long.

### Reflection

The frame was more difficuly to make than the dowel pins. When making my holes in the sides of the frame, I used the little trick you showed us in
class. I made the two holes on one side of the frame (centering them with some construction lines and a sketch mirror), and then mirrored the two holes
onto the other side using a mate connector as the mirror plane. The feature to use a mate connector as a plane is purely magical.

## Frame Assembly

### Description

The last part of the assignment was to assemble the frame parts with some dowel pins into a shape which looks like a picture frame. The bill of 
materials is as follows:

### Reflection

The Frame Assembly was not much of a hassle. I appreciated the intuitiveness of the menu in which you select the configuration to insert, and 
everything worked as expected. No problems to speak of, and that's a good thing.
