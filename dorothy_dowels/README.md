## Dowel Pin Configurations

### Description

The first part of Dorothy's Dowels was to make the dowel configurations. I made configurations for length, diameter, and having a chamfer. Below is a
 table of those different dowel configurations:

This is the default configuration for the dowel.

### Reflection

The Dowel Pin was very easy to make, and the configurations were surprisingly simple to use. It took me a minute or two to grasp exactly what I needed
to do to make a configuration, but once I got past that, they were statisfyingly simple and effective.

## Frame Configurations

### Description

The second part of the Dorothy's Dowels assignment was the frame. The frame was a 2" wide trapeziod with 45Â° sides, and had two configurations for it's 
length: the long version was 12" long, and the short version was 8" long.

### Reflection

The frame was more difficuly to make than the dowel pins. When making my holes in the sides of the frame, I used the little trick you showed us in
class. I made the two holes on one side of the frame (centering them with some construction lines and a sketch mirror), and then mirrored the two holes
onto the other side using a mate connector as the mirror plane. The feature to use a mate connector as a plane is purely magical.
