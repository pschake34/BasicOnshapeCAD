# Dorothy's Dowels

This is the project folder for the Dorothy's Dowels assignment. This README is my engineering notebook for Dorothy's Dowels. I will put in an image, 
description, and evidence for each small part, and have a final reflection with the completed assembly at the end.

## Base Dowel

### Description

The first part of Dorothy's Dowels was to make the base dowel, which will be modified using configurations to make the other sizes of dowel. This 
first dowel is 25.4mm (1in) long and has a diameter of 6.35mm.
