# Dorothy's Dowels

This is the project folder for the Dorothy's Dowels assignment. This README is my engineering notebook for Dorothy's Dowels. I will put in an image, 
description, and evidence for each small part, and have a final reflection with the completed assembly at the end.

## Dowel Configurations

### Description

The first part of Dorothy's Dowels was to make the dowel configurations. I made configurations for length, diameter, and having a chamfer. Below is a
 table of those different dowel configurations:
