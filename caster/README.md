# Caster

This is the project folder for the Caster assignment. This README chronicles the making of the Caster.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)


### Base

The base is pretty simple to make: one 120x200mm rectangle, and a few holes. I didn't run into any issues along the way, and I feel completely used to Onshape already.
