# Caster

This is the project folder for the Caster assignment. This README is my engineering notebook for the caster.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)

## Base

### Description

The base is the first assignment in the caster. It's a 120x200mm rectangle with six 10mm wide holes patterned in two directions, and evenly spaced throughout.

### Evidence

### Reflection

This first Onshape part was easy to make thanks to the [Onshape Fundamentals Course](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/learning-path/onshape-fundamentals-cad), and the detailed instructions in the assignment.


### Mount

The mount is extremely simple to make when building on the base sketch. Just one 120mm long line and 8mm extrusion later, I had a mount. Multi-part part studios are simply amazing.

### Fork

The fork was slightly more complicated, but still not a challenge with the simplicity of Onshape. The hardest part is remembering where to find the functions without keyboard shortcuts.

### Tire

The tire was the first part with a revolve, but that wasn't problem thanks to the practice in Onshape Fundamentals. No issues to report, just smooth sailing.

### Wheel

I made the wheel in the same part studio as the tire. It was definetely the most complex part, and I did run into an issue. I got through the sketching of the spoke hole without any problems, but when I filleted and patterned it, the hole looked wrong. I was left doubting myself, so I went through the sketch, the revolve, the fillet, and everything else I could come up with. Eventually, I decided to just watch the video on how to make it, and it turns out that the fillet in the instructions was too large (4mm instead of 2mm). Other than that mishap, the wheel rolled along smoothly.
