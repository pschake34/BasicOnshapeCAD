# Caster

This is the project folder for the Caster assignment. This README is a general overview of how the caster was made and my thoughts on how each part went. You can click on the image of a part for more detailed instructions.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)


### Base

The base is pretty simple to make: one 120x200mm rectangle, and a few holes. I didn't run into any issues along the way, and I feel completely used to Onshape already.

### Mount

The mount is extremely simple to make when building on the base sketch. Just one 120mm long line and 8mm extrusion later, I had a mount. Multi-part part studios are simply amazing.

### Fork

The fork was slightly more complicated, but still not a challenge with the simplicity of Onshape. The hardest part is remembering where to find the functions without keyboard shortcuts.
