# Caster

This is the project folder for the Caster assignment. This README is a general overview of how the caster was made and my thoughts on how each part went. You can click on the image of a part for more detailed instructions.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)


### Base

The base was pretty simple to make: one 120x200mm rectangle, and a few holes. I didn't run into any issues along the way, and I feel completely used to Onshape already.

### Mount

The mount is extremely simple to make when building on the base sketch. Just one 120mm long line and 8mm extrusion later, I had a mount. Multi-part part studios are simply amazing.

### Fork

The fork was slightly more complicated, but still not a challenge with the simplicity of Onshape. The hardest part is remembering where to find the functions without keyboard shortcuts.

### Tire

The tire was the first part with a revolve, but that wasn't problem thanks to the practice in Onshape Fundamentals. No issues to report, just smooth sailing.

### Wheel

The wheel was the most complex part so far, and I did run into an issue. I got through the sketching of the spoke wheel without any problems, but when I filleted and patterned it, the hole looked wrong. I was left doubting myself, so I went through the sketch, the revolve, the fillet, and anything else I could come up with. Eventually, I decided to just watch the video on how to make it, and it turns out that the fillet in the instructions was too large (4mm instead of 2mm). Other than that mishap, the wheel went smoothly.
