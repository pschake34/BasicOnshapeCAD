# Caster

This is the project folder for the Caster assignment. This README is my engineering notebook for the caster.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)

## Base

### Description

The base is the first assignment in the caster. It's a 120x200mm rectangle with six 10mm wide holes patterned in two directions, and evenly spaced throughout.

### Reflection

This first Onshape part was easy to make thanks to the [Onshape Fundamentals Course](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/learning-path/onshape-fundamentals-cad), and the detailed instructions in the assignment.



## Mount

### Description

The second part of the caster is the mount. It's a 120mm square which shares most of the geometry of the base.

### Reflection

Because the mount shares the geometry of the base, I made the two parts in the same Part Studio. This feature greatly reduced the time I had to put into the part, because I only had to add one line and one new extrusion. Multi-part part studios are simply amazing.



## Fork

### Description

The third part of the caster is the fork, a considerably more complex part than the first two. The fork consists of a circular base 80mm in diameter, two prongs which are 80mm long and filleted down 15mm, and a 60mm long cylindrical stem.

### Reflection

The fork was slightly more complicated, but still not a challenge with the simplicity of Onshape. The hardest part for me was remembering where to find the functions which don't command the honor of being designated a keyboard shortcut.



## Tire

### Description

### Evidence

### Reflection

The tire was the first part with a revolve, but that wasn't problem thanks to the practice in Onshape Fundamentals. No issues to report, just smooth sailing.

## Wheel

### Description

### Evidence

### Reflection

I made the wheel in the same part studio as the tire. It was definetely the most complex part, and I did run into an issue. I got through the sketching of the spoke hole without any problems, but when I filleted and patterned it, the hole looked wrong. I was left doubting myself, so I went through the sketch, the revolve, the fillet, and everything else I could come up with. Eventually, I decided to just watch the video on how to make it, and it turns out that the fillet in the instructions was too large (4mm instead of 2mm). Other than that mishap, the wheel rolled along smoothly.
