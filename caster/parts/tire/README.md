# Tire

This file documents my making of the Caster Tire. The Onshape part studio I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/3c0210e8dc1e0fa13d604cdf)

### Main Sketch

This sketch is a few lines, dimensioned to be angular. The revolve dimensions can be created by clicking the line, and then the horizontal construction line.

### Complete

The only things left to do are revolving the sketch aroung the horizontal construction line, and filleting the outer edges 8mm. When complete, your tire should look like this:
