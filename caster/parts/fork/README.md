# Fork

The fork is the first part that actually made me think about how I would do something. The following sketch images detail how I made the fork. The part studio with the part is [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/193e1eacaf17ddfab84b5875)

### Main Circle

The main circle is just an 80mm circle centered on the origin, extruded 8mm.

### Prongs

The prongs are sketched on one side of the main circle. I used a construction line to get the rectangle away from the origin. The prong sketch is extruded 80mm, and filleted down 15mm.

### Prong Hole

For the hole in the prongs, I again used a construction line to center the hole in the middle of the prong, and just extruded through all.

### Stem

The circular stem of the Fork is made up of two circles centered on the origin, and extruded up 60mm.

### Completion

The final step is putting in some fillets and chamfers which can be found in the Onshape document above. When you're finished, it should look like this:
