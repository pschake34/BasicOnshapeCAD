# Mount

The mount is extremely simple to make when building on the instructions for the base outlined [here.](/caster/parts/base/README.md) The part studio with the part is [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/44d11c822fc5279efa47b295/w/90300413fc4f16957eadc67b/e/28092cdd77be910dc765f2cd)

All you need to do is edit the Base Sketch and add one line as illustrated here:

<img src="/caster/parts/mount/images/edit_base_sketch.png" width="600px" height="360px" alt="Base Sketch Edit">

Then extrude the new square 8mm in the opposite direction of the base (make sure that you select new, not add), and move the new extrusion above the hole sketches so the holes will cut through the mount as well. Your mount should look like this:
