# Onshape Challenge

The Onshape Challenge assignment was to create a universal joint -- the same as the one used for last year's Engineering 1 midterm. This is the project
folder for the Onshape challenge, and this README is its engineering notebook. I timed myself doing the assigment, and it took me 54 minutes.

The Onshape document which I'm working on can be found [here.](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/960910b4e98ce4e4f0341b9a)

## Cube Thingy

### Description

The first part of the assignment was to create the cube thingy. The cube thingy consists of a 20mm cube, and 1 circle centered on one face of the cube, 
extruded 10mm. The cylinder is patterned circularly around a mate connector so that there is a cylinder on four sides of the cube.

### Reflection

The cube thingy was satisfyingly simple to make, and I had no issues following along with the instructions. The circular pattern feature was especially 
satisfying because I used a mate connector as the axis and it worked as I intended on the first try.

## Spinner Shaft

### Description

The second part of the universal joint was the creation of the spinner shaft. The main body of the spinner shaft is a 30mm circle extruded 50mm to create 
a cylinder. A 10mm circle is then extruded 20mm from the center of one side of the main body, and a 20mm wide rectangle is sketched on the other side of 
the cylinder, and remove-extruded down 30mm to create two prongs. One prong has a 8mm hole cut out of it (centered 10mm from the top), has two rectangles 
cut out of it so that it is 13mm wide, and has 4mm fillets on all of the sharp edges. Those features are then mirrored onto the other prong.

### Reflection

The spinner shaft was fairly complicated, and while I didn't run into any major issues, I did have to mess around with the prong dimensions and fillets
in order to get it to look completely correct. This was definitely the most difficult part of the universal joint.

## Bracket

### Description

The bracket was sketched as a lines without an enclosed shape, extruded 40mm symmetrically to make a surface, and then thickened inward by 5mm. The 
dimensions for the sketch are below:

### Reflection

The bracket was a bit tricky, but thanks to the tips Mr. H gave us in class about extruding a line into a solid, I was able to figure it out pretty 
quickly. My only little hiccup was that I couldn't figure out what the dimensions for the fillets were, so I had to look them up in the assignment rubric.

## Final Assembly

### Description

The final assembly was the last part of the universal joint, and put together one cube thingy, two spinner shafts, and one bracket. Only five mates were
required to make the universal joint function as intended: a fastened mate keeping the bracket attached to the origin, one cylindrical mate each for the
spinner shafts to attach to the bracket, and finally one revolute mate each for the spinner shafts to attach to the cube thingy.

### Reflection

The final assembly was amazingly simple to make in Onshape when compared to Solidworks. I was astounded that I could get everything to work properly with
only 5 mates. Also, I figured out how to animate the movement of an assmbly -- you right-click the mate you want to use as a driving mate, and select 
"**Animate**" it's pretty intuitive after that, but I found the [Onshape documentation](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/help/Content/mate.htm?cshid=animate_mate#animate)
was useful for figuring out some specifics.
