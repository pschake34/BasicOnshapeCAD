# Vacuum Pump

Our collaboration challenge was to make a vacuum pump as a team. My team consisted of Max, Reece, and myself. This is the project folder for Vacuum Pump,
and this README is its engineering notebook. I will be doing write-ups for each of the parts which I created, as well as the assembly. If possible, I will 
link to the engineering notebooks created by my partners.

The Onshape Document which we worked on can be found [here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/8eda673fefaec82919b2605d)

## Outer Cylinder

### Description

The first part which I was delegated to create was the outer cylinder. We decided on 80mm for the outer diameter, and 70mm for the inner diameter. It was
extruded 210mm.

### Reflection

This part posed no challenge whatsoever. The only thing I have to note is that I had to change the dimensions multiple times in order to make part fit in
with the rest of the parts in the final assembly.

## Plunger

### Description

The second part which I created was the plunger. I created this part in the same part studio as the outer cylinder, and used the inner diameter of said 
part as the outer diameter of the plunger. The plunger's inner diameter was 20mm (congruent with Max's master cylinder), and the part was extruded 25mm.
Another ring was cut out of the main extrusion so that each surface of the plunger was 5mm thick.

### Reflection

I don't really have a lot to say about the plunger. Making it was a breeze and I ran into no issues.

## Stopper Ring

### Description

The stopper ring was the final part which I was responsible for making. I built it in the same part studio as the first two parts, and I used the inner
diameter of the plunger for the inner diameter of this part. The outer diameter of the stopper ring was 35mm, and it was extruded to 5mm thick.

### Reflection

The creation of the stopper ring was an excruciatingly difficult and grueling experience, or as I said in the previous part, making it was a breeze and I
ran into no issues.

## Final Assembly

### Description

The final assembly was put together by everybody in our group. All of the mates were normal fastened mates except for the mate between the stopper ring 
and the master cylinder, which was a fastened mate with a 53mm offset, and the mate between the master cylinder and the top, which was a slider mate. The
bill of materials is listed below:

### Reflection

The only minor mistake which I made during the creation of final assembly was that I added the limits on the movement of the master cylinder too early.
This meant that every time we had to change the dimensions, I had to change the limits. I was very impressed with the sophistication of Onshape's 
collaboration features. Having experienced the nightmare of trying to collaborate in Solidworks, I really enjoyed being able to work on one document at 
the same time as two other people.
